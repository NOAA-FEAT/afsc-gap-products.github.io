# Onboarding new users

In order for this GitHub organization to serve GAP well, We need to develop approaches for use that suit every type of user: from people who only want to use the web interface to check on projects, to collaborative coders who are using git for version control every day. 

## The benefits of using GitHub
Here is our list of "selling points" for using a github org to store code and do project management.

### Features that can be used entirely through the web interface
1. **Issue tracker discussion boards** can be used to pass on institutional knowledge. For us, these are things like strata boundaries. Issue trackers make these discussions searchable for anyone who is doing an analysis for the first time.
2. You can **see what scripts look like**, without needing to run them.
3. **Version control**. Keep track of what team members have changed. 

## How can I convince my colleagues to use the GitHub organization?
1. Make sure you have **self-contained projects** to contribute to, and have a *support structure* for team members when they join. Foster [psychological safety](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/what-is-psychological-safety-at-work/) while teaching people how to use the tools.
2. Help people set up their GitHub accounts (SCRUG members have developed a how-to [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxC9GhTvw1fNMC3wBUmBoyf4WDiqVa0Po4NP2A8n2hM/edit?usp=sharing))
3. Provide a way for people to get **low-risk practice with the tools**
4. Use great **examples of existing repos** as a “selling point” and show people the advantages of using them. Make sure there are both simple and more complex examples to follow, so that there is something for everyone.
5. **Focus on documentation!** The simpler the solutions are and the better documented, the easier it is for people to get on board. We thank Stacie Hardy for this insight. Producing documentation can also be a great way for new people to get involved.
6. **Set examples.** Folks who are already active users, by participating, can show others both how to use GitHub and what its benefits are.
7. **Foster continuous learning**: everyone has something new to learn all the time! Host ongoing co-working sessions and trainings, with a growth mindset.
