# FEAT Data Products
This is the landing page for the noaa-feat-products organization. Please go to the GitHub page for any code needs. We are experimenting with where to put certain resources for GAP. For example, should we put our "best practices" documents here, or link them in the brief header on our [organization page](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/)? 

## Onboarding
Are you looking for ideas or resources about how to onboard people from your NOAA team who are brand new to GitHub? We put together some ideas [here](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/pages/onboarding).

## Data requests
We are working on a framework for integrating basic [data requests](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/data-requests) into our GitHub workflow. 

## Where to begin?
If you are new to GitHub or to the AFSC GAP Survey Data Products org, check out the [main GitHub page](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products), or look at the [setup repo issue tracker](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/setup/issues) if you're interested in contributing.
