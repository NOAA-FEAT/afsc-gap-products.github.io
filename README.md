# AFSC Gap Products
This is the landing page for the afsc-gap-products organization. Please go to the GitHub page for any code needs. We are experimenting with where to put certain resources for GAP. For example, should we put our "best practices" documents here, or link them in the brief header on our [organization page](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/)? 

## Onboarding
Are you looking for ideas or resources about how to onboard people from your NOAA team who are brand new to GitHub? We put together some ideas here.
