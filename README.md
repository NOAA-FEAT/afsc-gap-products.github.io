# Welcome to the FEAT Organization! 
This is the landing page for the NOAA-FEAT GitHub Organization. Please go to individual repositories for any code needs. We are experimenting with where to put certain resources for FEAT. For example, should we put our "best practices" documents here, or link them in the brief header on our [organization page](https://github.com/noaa-feat-products/)? 

## Onboarding
Are you looking for ideas or resources about how to onboard people from your NOAA team who are brand new to GitHub? AFSC GAP put together some ideas [here](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/pages/onboarding).

## Data requests
We are working on a framework for integrating basic [data requests](https://github.com/noaa-feat/data-requests) into our GitHub workflow; stay tuned. Data requests and queries can be made from the FRAM Data Warehouse [github page](https://github.com/nwfsc-fram/warehouse)

## Where to begin?
If you are new to GitHub, check out the [main GitHub page](https://github.com/noaa-feat), or look at the [setup repo issue tracker](https://github.com/noaa-feat/setup/issues) if you're interested in contributing.
